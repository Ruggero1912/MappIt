STEPS:
    1. We iterate over the places that are present in Places' MongoDB Collection
    For each place:
        1. extract the name and the coordinates of the place
        2. iterate over the activities (that are in /documentation/activities.json)
        For each activity:
            Iterate over the tags of the activity.
            For each tag:
                1. Query YouTube API specifying:
                    - as tags the place's name and the given tag
                    - as coordinates the given coordinates for the current place
                2. For each result of the query create a Post document, using the fields:
                    {
                        "title"     : "",
                        "date"      : date, //the date of the post
                        "desc"      : "",   //the description of the post
                        "place"     : "", //the _id of the place of the post
                        "activity"  : "", //the name (TODO: or _id if we decide to add it to MongoDB) of the kind of activity related to this post
                        "tags"      : [], //an (optional) array of strings useful for better categorization and indexing
                        "YTlink"    : "", //the link to the YT video (this attribute is present only if the post contains a video from YT)
                        "GAccount"  : ""  //the ID of the Google Account associated to the given YT video (this attribute is present only if the post contains a video from YT)
                    }
