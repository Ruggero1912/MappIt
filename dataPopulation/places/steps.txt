STEPS:

1. The overpass_getter is responsible to retrieve the data from the overpass API and save it to a file .osm (OpenStreetMaps format).
2. After that we take the data in osm format and convert it to GeoJSON using the library (https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson)
3. Once we have the places information in GeoJSON format, we have to create a document per each element.
    The place document should have this field:
    - "_id"     : /*given by MongoDB*/
    - "name"    : /*it is the same that is present in the GeoJSON document, but it has a its own field just in case the OSM name will not be used*/
    - "lon"     :
    - "lat"     :
        //the polygon's (or point's) centroid (to be extracted using Python Library shapely (or similiar))
        //it is useful to perform searches by distance 
    - "type"    : /**/
    - "fits"    : /*["drone", "photography", "skiing", "surfing", "trekking", "" ...] */
        //"fits" is an attribute that indicates the suggested activities that could be done in that place
        //those categories are extracted by the kind of posts made for that place
        // (it introduces redundancy but it is useful because it let us query the db by category of interests much more easily)
    - "image"   : /*a link to the image chosen to represent the place*/
        //https://serpapi.com/images-results
        //filter parameter tbs=iar:s to obtain only square aspect ratio images
        //wikipedia images API
    - "geoJSON" : {/*a document containing the geojson feature obtained for that place*/}
